## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first experience with mobile-first web design. I have used CSS styling for screen-width < 500px as default, and then using a media-query for desktop widths.

Further, I have set a maximum width for the component such that the component will stay at approximately the same scale when extending the window after the 500px threshold is reached.

### Continued development

I am going to start now to work on larger projects, full web pages now that I have developed a few individual components.

### Useful resources

- [How to write mobile-first CSS](https://zellwk.com/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css/) - This gave me a good conceptual understanding of mobile-first CSS.
